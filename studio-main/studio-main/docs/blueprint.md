# **App Name**: Rasa Grader

## Core Features:

- Taste Grade Generation: Generates a taste grade (A, B, C, or D) based on API data, simulating randomization by a tool. 
- Rasa Display: Displays the 6 rasas (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, astringent) with randomized dilution and quality levels. Mock data will be used until the API key is connected.
- API Key Input: Provides an input field for the user to enter their API key.
- Real-Time Data Fetching: Fetches and displays real-time data from the backend using the provided API key.
- Landscape Mode Optimization: Optimizes the UI for landscape mode on mobile devices, dividing the screen into two main sections.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) for a sense of depth and expertise.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1), a desaturated near-tone of the primary, creating a clean backdrop that emphasizes key information and UI elements.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC107) for highlighting the taste grade and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. This balances modernity and readability.
- Two-part division: Taste grade (left) and rasa details/API key input (right) to utilize landscape mode effectively.
- Subtle transitions when fetching and displaying real-time data, to give a sense of liveness without distracting the user.
